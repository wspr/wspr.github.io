We use real-time control hardware in our labs in the School of Mechanical Engineering,
The University of Adelaide.
These tend to be dedicated pieces of equipment that contain, very broadly:

* A processor capable of running in ‘real time’ — usually 1000 Hz and up.
* Analogue input and output connections
* Digital input and output connections

In the past we used the Matlab-based dSpace platform for this, but dSpace platforms are expensive and
cannot be easily expanded.
SpeedGoat sell more modular systems but these are PC-based not that cheap either.

More recently, I've been using National Instruments CompactRio systems with some success.
Although my students don't particularly enjoy programming in Labview, they can generally
get the job done — and the more code we write, the more we can re-use.

The main strength of the CompactRio system is its modularity. Their range of I/O cards
covers a wide range of requirements, from asynchronous multi-channel to synchronous high-speed,
at a range of bit rates.

The one aspect of using National Instruments hardware that took some getting used to was
