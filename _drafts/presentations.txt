Title:	Effective presentations

Presentations are hard.
Not only does it take much longer than you think to illustrate your points with slides, and much harder than you think to explain your ideas logically and clearly, but additionally it's scary and nerve-wracking to actually stand up in front of people and just talk.

I'm not great at explaining how one should prepare to give a presentation, but I've come across a few good pointers in my time. Unfortunately, the solution to the nerves thing is simply to talk in front of different audiences so many times that it no longer fazes you. There's no other way around it.

Luckily, the rest of the game is fairly easy to teach. If your content is polished and rehearsed, a few nerves will only be a minor issue.
