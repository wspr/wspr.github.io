A yoga bibliography

In the period around 2011 through 2015, yoga became a primary interest of mine.
It started as a [physical practise](http://willwont.blogspot.com.au/2011/11/this-is-long-rambling-story-about-me.html),
and relatively quickly turned into an intellectual pursuit in addition.

During those years I read quite a number of books on yoga, and I wish I'd kept
better notes at the time. The list here is a retrospective before yet more of
what I learned slips away from me.

### Shadow Yoga Chaya Yoga, Shandor Remete

Cautiously recommended, if at all, for the casual reader.
The introductory sections of this book outline the how and why of yoga in a
beautifully concise manner, and the book becomes increasingly esoteric as it progresses.
Some real pearls of wisdom, which suit repeated reflection and provide signposts for further study.

Recommended without question for anyone with an interest in some of yoga's esoteric qualities.
Required reading for anyone getting more serious about Shadow Yoga.


### Anatomy of Hatha Yoga, H David Coulter

This was perhaps the first yoga book I purchased, and it is probably my favourite book on yoga bar none.

This book was written over a 25 year period by a former neuroscience and anatomy professor, and the detail presented in discussing anatomical movements from a clearly experienced yoga background is refreshing.
While other yoga anatomy books tend to cover many poses in light detail, this book (while comprehensive) covers fewer poses in more detail.
This book explicitly only discusses elements of yoga which can be discussed within an accepted modern medical context; it does not overstep its interpretation in trying to unify yoga and science in a holistic sense.

The writing style is engaging, full of wit and intelligent humour. Of a few favourite passages are those which contrast the experiences of a beginner student to the descriptions of the `correct' form of a pose. For example, in a discussion of a sitting forward bend:

> [The beginning student] ... will be acutely aware and frustrated that they are already bent forard at their hips to their limit just trying to sit up straight.
> They also won't be very appreciative of the instructor who softly intones “let gravity gently carry you forward” when gravity is pulling the nowhere but backward.

Later, when discussing hip flexibility in general:

> ... those whose hips are not flexible are practically a different species...
> ... And as far as doing a credible sitting forard bend with the thighs abducted is concerned, they might as well try flying.

Coming back to this book after a long period, my only complaint is that there are no references to the Sanscrit names for the common poses.
This is sensible when viewed from the perspective of a beginning student, but the Sanscrit terminology is so pervasive in the yoga world that including the Sanscrit names when first introducing the poses would help to cross-reference this work with other books.
