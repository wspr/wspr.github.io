<p>This year&rsquo;s been a bit of a rollercoaster for being busy and trying to make decisions. After flipping-flopping over the last six months, I&rsquo;ve decided at the last minute to attend <a href="http://tug.org/tug2012/">TUG 2012</a> in Boston in July. (Thanks to Steve Peter, president, for the gentle nudge that finally sorted me out.)</p>

<p>TUG is the annual conference of the TeX Users Group, and I attended it for the first time in San Francisco in 2010. It was the best conference I&rsquo;ve been to, and I&rsquo;m expecting to have a great time in Boston as well. I&rsquo;ve barely been to the east coast of the US, so I&rsquo;m excited to explore the city in the days around the conference.</p>

<p>For my presentation, I&rsquo;ll talk about LaTeX3 from a fairly high level, why it exists, why I work on it, and other assorted aspects of my somewhat-dormant TeX work. (Spoiler: without LaTeX3 I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to develop <code>unicode-math</code>; it would simply have been too much work.) If there&rsquo;s anything in particularly you think I should address, feel free to drop me a line beforehand.</p>

<p>If you yourself are attending the conference, please say hi. What do people like to drink in Boston? I&rsquo;ll buy you one.</p>
