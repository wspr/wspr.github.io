<p>Life has become rather busy and complicated in the last few years, so apologies to any readers that hoped for more from me on the LaTeX front. I live in optimism, however, that things will imminently pick up.</p>

<p>One of my favourite and least useful packages I&rsquo;ve written is <a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/vwcol">vwcol</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty scary to think that I wrote it almost seven years ago; where does the time fly? It&rsquo;s so old that it wasn&rsquo;t even version controlled.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago someone <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/63191/colored-rule-and-reference-current-column-width-in-vwcol/63349">asked on TeX.sx</a> whether it could draw rules of different colours. An easy fix, but I apparently ran out of time on it; I revisited the problem after being pinged about it again, it turns out that I fixed the code but never uploaded it to CTAN!</p>

<p>Silly old Will. Well, in an effort to get the ball rolling again, vwcol now has a <a href="https://github.com/wspr/vwcol">Github repository</a> and a new version is making its way to CTAN with very few changes except the new <code>rulecolor</code> option.</p>

<p>A belated happy new year.</p>
