Here&rsquo;s a photo I took of Donald Knuth at the TUG 2010 conference
during his “Earthshaking Announcement”.
I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how it has been distributed (perhaps Facebook)
but I see it&rsquo;s now floating around the internet.
I&rsquo;m not a big stickler for attribution in this case—I&rsquo;m quite
happy the photo turned out this well at all, let alone good enough for
others to use. In any event, I thought it would be a good idea to clear
up who the original author of the photograph was.

For future reference, I’m happy for my photographs to be freely used
with attribution. Should really start making more of them public…
