Usually when I see people talking about browser extensions I think “oh neat, but I don’t want to fuss around with a complex set of configurations that becomes unportable over time”. Or I think “that’s cute, but I’m not paying a few dollars for a tweak I will probably forget about”. 

John Gruber [linked to Stop The Madness](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/15/stopthemadness-pro) recently and again I thought it was interesting but not worth the mental hassle of integrating a new tool into my browsing habits. But I’m sitting on the bus right now, listening to music while catching up on some news. And as I scroll through the website my music fades away and some auto-play video has taken over. And my gosh do I do not want to be watching some tangentially related video on your site right now. Cue me leaving the webpage. 

I remembered this wouldn’t be an issue if I had some kind of way to stop the madness. And the initial hook for the app — replace Arial with Helvetica! — is certainly a typography issue that I feel strongly about. I am now a Safari extension convert, and I’m quite impressed with the various features that [Stop The Madness provides](https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/). Particularly happy that it uses iCloud sync to keep options configured across browsers on Mac, iPad, and iPhone (as long as you are happy using Safari everywhere, which I am). 

Now I just need to remember to install it everywhere for all time…
