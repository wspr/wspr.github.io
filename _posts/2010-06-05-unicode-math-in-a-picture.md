<p>If you haven’t seen <a href="http://latex-alive.tumblr.com/post/659990256/release">unicode-math</a> or really understood what it does, see the image below for one of its features.</p>

<p>Writing maths like this isn’t any <em>faster</em> than using normal LaTeX commands, but it sure makes reading and editing the stuff far easier.</p>

<p>Compare this with the Mathematica programming language, say. There, it allows you to write programs with either variable names or mathematical symbols; for many purposes, using the symbols increases the readability and maintainability of your code. I think the same thing applies for writing LaTeX documents.</p>

<p>Using symbols certainly isn’t always better, but I think that sometimes it will be. And it sure helps to make LaTeX source look less intimidating to a new user, don’t you think?</p>
