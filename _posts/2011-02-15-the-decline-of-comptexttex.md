Newsgroups in 2011 are an anachronism from the younger days of the
internet, and access to them is rather more limited than it used to be.
Google provides a web interface to them through Google Groups but in
recent years it’s slowly been more and more spam-afflicted.

Is this a indication, perhaps, that TeX use itself is diminishing? I
don’t think you can really argue this, as posts on c.t.t. hardly reflect
consistent usage numbers over time—if newcomers to TeX and friends find
Q&A sites like Stack Exchange I think they’ll be far less likely to want
to use Google Groups, which is far more clunky with a poorer
signal-to-noise ratio.

But it’s still a shame (or perhaps just a nostalgic twinge) to see a
community in decline, even while new ones are coming into being. Despite
this, the c.t.t. archives are full of valuable information, and even if
new postings diminish the group will live on as a historical record of
helpful answers. When in doubt,
